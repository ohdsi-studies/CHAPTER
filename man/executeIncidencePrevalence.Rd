\arguments{
\item{dbConnection}{An object of type \code{dbConnection} as created using the
\code{\link[DBI]{dbConnect}} function in the
DBI package.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your patient-level data in OMOP CDM format resides.

schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{cohortDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where intermediate data can be stored. You will need to have
write privileges in this schema. Note that for SQL Server, this should
include both the database and schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{cohortStem}{The table stem for the name of the tables that will be created in the 
work database schema.
These tables will hold the exposure and outcome cohorts used in this
study.}

\item{outputFolder}{Name of local folder to place results; make sure to use forward slashes
(/). Do not use a folder on a network drive since this greatly impacts
performance.}

\item{databaseId}{A short string for identifying the database (e.g.
'Synpuf').}

\item{readCohorts}{A boolean to choose whether to read and instantiate the initial cohorts
from the available jsons.}

\item{createCovidCohorts}{A boolean to choose whether to create the COVID related cohorts.}
